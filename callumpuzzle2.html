you get up and go to the door. you look down and see nothing you think it would be ok to go down and see what the 
noise was coming from. A 
ZOMBIE, you istantly run into a room on the right but the zombie saw you and it was coming up the stairs. you shut the door 
and the zombie starts banging on it. the door cames off its hinges and you see three zombies there they grab 
you and start eating you alive. THE END.
