You get up and go to the door. You look down and see nothing you think it would be ok to go down and see what the noise was. On your way down you see a ZOMBIE, you istantly run into a room on the right but the zombie saw you and it was coming. You shut the door 
and the zombie starts banging on the door. The door comes off its hinges and you see three zombies there they grab you and start eating you alive. THE END.
