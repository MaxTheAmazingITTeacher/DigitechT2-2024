                You find yourself in a really quite huge room. <br>
                Actually, it is enourmous but I wasn't sure how to spell that!
            </p>
            <p>
                There are three doors. The one to your right is red, and has a small 'no entry' sign
                on it.<br>
                To your right is a tiny door, <b>that</b> is <bold>slightly</bold> ajar. Through it you can see strange
                flickering lights, and hear a low moaning.<br>
                Ahead is a yellow door. It appears to be locked, but there is a large key in the lock.<br>
                Behind you you hear the sound of clanking armour...<br>
                <br>
                Make your choice...
