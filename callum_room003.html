            You head to the door and look up and down. Seeing nothing you head up the stairs and go in a door on the righthand side.
             Two zombies are dead on the floor and the person that brought you here was bleeding on the floor. 
            He groaned "go away or else". You run up the stairs faster never looking back. You see a door on the right. <br>
