                Option 3 The steep hill.
                As you carefully descend the hill,<br>
                 you can make out what appears to be a stream running along the bottom.<br>
                  The water looks clear enough to drink.<br>
                   At this point,<br>
                    you have no choice.<br>
                     If you dont drink,<br>

                     youll die from dehydration. You kneel next to the stream and cup some water into your hands. It tastes clean and refreshing. After a few hours you feel revitalised. Continuing along the path near the stream you see two more tracks. One leads to the mouth of the river (Option 5), the other a baron plain (Option 6).
