            You waited for the night and you were ready to go down the stairs to the garage. <br>
            You open the door to see 2 zombies, you stumble backwards and trip on a shovel, <br>
            the zombies lunge at you and start to eat you, making you one of them.

            <p>
                You have died, go back to first page.
