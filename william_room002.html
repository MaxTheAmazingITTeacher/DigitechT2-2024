            You decided it was best to follow your gut feeling so you walked back up the stairs to find yourself at the door you just left moments ago <br>
            however you remember closing the door when you thought it was okay idea to move further down the building and escape maybe but to find the door open? <br>
             strangely when you have that thought you begin to hear rustling through the door not sure what it might be. What is that groaning noise? <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Should i go investegate, or have second thoughts about coming back up?
