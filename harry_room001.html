             You end up in a garage and you see two vehicles,<br>
             A rusty old car and a motorbike<br>
             You check the motorbike,and it has a quarter of a tank left<br>  
             You check the rusty old car, but you see a sign that says, “doesnt work, don't bother”<br> 
             you look around for any other hope.<br>
             You see a fuel bucket that has 50L in it. What are your choices are<br>
