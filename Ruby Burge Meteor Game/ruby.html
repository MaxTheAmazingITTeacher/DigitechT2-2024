        Surroundings are clear and breath of relief as nobody is there. <br>
        You feel safe as if you have finally escaped this nightmare. <br>
        Something smells funny, you look up and see pieces of ash falling apon you. <br>
        You have to navigate your way through the ashes and continue on...
