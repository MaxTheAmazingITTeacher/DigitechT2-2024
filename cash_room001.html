        <main>
            <p>
                You run up the fire escape stairs and you open the door to the roof with force and you slam it it behind you, <br>
                You drag a wheelbarrow and shelves to barricade the door.<br>
                you look around and see a vast fruit garden that contained a wall with a vine that spreaded against the wall, <br>
                and a half full tank of water. <br>
                you snack on on the fruits and drink the water from the tank. <br>
                After a day you are ready to move
            </p>
            <p>
                You have 3 choices. <br>
                Turn right, jump to the next roof. <br>
                Turn left, wait the next day. <br>
                Go forward, go down the stairs. <br>
