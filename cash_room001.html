			The Roof

			<p>
				You run up the fire escape stairs and you open the door to the roof with force and you slam it it behind you,
				<br>
				You drag a wheelbarrow and shelves to barricade the door.<br>
				you look around and see a vast fruit garden that contained a wall with a vine that spreaded against the wall,
				<br>
				and a half full tank of water. <br>
				you snack on on the fruits and drink the water from the tank. <br>
				After a day you are ready to move
			</p>
			<p>
				You have 3 choices. <br>
				Turn right, jump to the next roof. <br>
				Turn left, wait the next day. <br>
				Go forward, go down the stairs. <br>
