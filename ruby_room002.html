            You now have the confidence to look behind you to see if you are alone.  <br>
            </p>
            <p>
            Surroundings are clear <br>
            You find yourself looking at a large fence with overgrown grass. <br>
            It will be empty of people. 
            A breath of relief as nobody is there. <br>
            You feel safe as if you have finally escaped this nightmare. <br>
