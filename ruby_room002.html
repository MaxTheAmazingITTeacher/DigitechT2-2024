            You now have the confidence to look behind you to see if you are alone.  <br>
            </p>
            <p>
            Surroundings are clear <br>
            A breath of relief as nobody is there. <br>
            You feel safe as if you have finally escaped this nightmare. <br>
            Something smells funny, you look up and see pieces of ash falling apon you. <br>
            You have to navigate your way through the ashes and continue on... <br>
