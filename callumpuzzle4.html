           <br> You decide that they are celebrating about something. You slowly fall asleep, now dreaming about zombies eating you. You feel a big pain on your arm you look at it and see a zombie eating it. You struggle to get away when you do,
            the zombie makes the worst sound you could ever hear. At once more zombies come in, they see you fighting the other zombie. YOU DIE HORRIBLY. THE END.<br>
