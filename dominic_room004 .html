             Mouth of the river
Youve reached what appears to the end or the mouth of the river. As you approach the still water,
 a crocodille leaps out from the water and bites you on the leg.
  Blood begins to pour out and you become lightheaded.
   Collapsing on the ground,
   the last thing you see is the crocodile moving towards you to finish you off.
    (You die)
