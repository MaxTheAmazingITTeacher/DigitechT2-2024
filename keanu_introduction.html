                You are sitting against a tree. The sun is flickering through the branches of the tall trees above you, their branches swayed by the gentle summer breeze. The dry leaves beneath you are so comfortable, the air temperature so pleasant, that you feel you might just fall asleep. 

                Then! Crashing through the branches and leaves behind you, you hear footsteps. Running. First just one set, then more, and more. A girl sprints past you, not noticing you, just running. By her panting breath you can tell she has been running for some time. 
                
                You stand, concerned. Then another girl and a man run past. This time the man notices you, his head half turning as he runs past, never slowing his pace. 
                
                “Run!” he shouts – although the shout is not loud, it is urgent. 
                
                “What’s the problem?” you think. “I’ll just wait and find out.”. But just then a group of people, from teenagers to adults, come running past. Those that see you seem incredulous to see you standing still. This makes up your mind for you – and you start running after the group. 
                
                As you run you see many groups of people off to your left and right – they are all running, almost frantically, but none seem to have a destination in mind, simply taking any path they can through the trees. 
                
                Your heart is thumping in your chest, you are out of breath and scared – even though you don’t know what you are scared of! But you keep running, taking whatever is the easiest route between the trees.
